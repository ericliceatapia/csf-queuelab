# Queue Lab
Course project for Computer Systems Fundamentals

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of the Queue Lab, an assignment focused on assessing C programming skills through explicit memory management, pointer-based data structures, and robust code implementation. The goal is to modify `queue.h` and `queue.c` while adhering to best practices and passing all test cases using the provided autograder.  

This assignment was submitted on September 9, 2024 through GitHub Classroom.

## Project Structure
- **`queue.h`** – Header file containing queue structure definitions.
- **`queue.c`** – Implementation file for queue functions.
- **`qtest`** – Command-line program to test queue functionality.
- **`Makefile`** – Build system to compile `qtest`.
- **`driver.py`** – Script for automatic grading.
- **`traces/`** – Directory containing test cases.
- **`instructions.md`** - Detailed .md file containing assignment instructions.
- **`README.md`** – This file.

## Technologies Used
- C programming language
- Vim text editor
- Unix-based development environment
